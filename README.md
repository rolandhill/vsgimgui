# vsgimgui
Integrating ImGui with VulkanSceneGraph
Roland Hill
Don Burns

This repository contains working files for integrating ImGui with VSG. It takes the form of a VSG viewer that displays a hardwired teapot with the ImGui Demo window overlaid.

There are still numerous Vulkan debug messages.
Mouse integration is included, but keyboard integration needs to be done.

After you build vsgimgui, you need to copy teapot.vsgt into the bin directory.
